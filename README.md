## Background
The data used in this personal project was collected from the donor database of Blood Transfusion Service Center in Hsin-Chu City, Taiwan. The center passes its blood transfusion service bus to one university in Hsin-Chu City to gather blood donated about every three months. The dataset  was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of a random sample of 748 donors. **My task is to predict if a blood donor will donate within a given time window.**
